# Fibonacci-Sequence
After tackling some challenges in HTML and CSS, and dabbling with the creative side of the right brain, I decided to engage my left brain with some JavaScript challenges. One of my initial projects involved creating a program capable of displaying the quantity of items entered and generating a sequence based on the input. This led me to explore the fascinating world of the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Integrating this concept into my project not only enhanced its functionality but also deepened my understanding of algorithmic patterns. Feel free to suggest improvements to my solution!
